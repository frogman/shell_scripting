Some great examples from: https://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/using/netstat

Graph # of connections for each hosts.
netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED | awk '{print $5}' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{ printf("%s\t%s\t",$2,$1) ; for (i = 0; i < $1; i++) {printf("*")}; print "" }'

List the number and type of active network connections
netstat -ant | awk '{print $NF}' | grep -v '[a-z]' | sort | uniq -c

Find All computers connected to my host
netstat -lantp | grep ESTABLISHED |awk '{print $5}' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | sort -u

Show which programs are listening on TCP and UDP ports
-p Tell me the name of the program and it's PID -l that is listening -u on a UDP port. -n Give me numeric IP addresses (don't resolve them) -t oh, also TCP ports 
netstat -plunt

###COUNT Number of connectios per IP on the server###
netstat -ntu | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

####Count against ddos attack###
netstat -anp |grep 'tcp\|udp' | awk '{print $5}' | sed s/::ffff:// | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

See KeepAlive counters on tcp connections
netstat -town

List programs with open ports and connections
netstat -ntauple

List top 20 IP from which TCP connection is in SYN_RECV state. Useful on web servers to detect a syn flood attack. Replace SYN_ with ESTA to find established connections
netstat -pant 2> /dev/null | grep SYN_ | awk '{print $5;}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -20

Show in a web server, running in the port 80, how many ESTABLISHED connections by ip it has.
netstat -ant | grep :80 | grep ESTABLISHED | awk '{print $5}' | awk -F: '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
